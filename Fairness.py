The Fairlearn open-source package provides postprocessing and reduction unfairness mitigation algorithms:
  
(1) ExponentiatedGradient - reduction - Binary classification and regression - Demographic parity, equalized odds
(2) GridSearch - reduction -Binary classification and regression - Demographic parity, equalized odds / Bounded group loss
(3) ThresholdOptimizer - postprocessing - Binary classification - Demographic parity, equalized odds

Demographic parity: any
True positive rate parity: any
False-positive rate parity: any
Equalized odds: any
Error rate parity: reduction-based mitigation algorithms (Exponentiated Gradient and Grid Search) 
Bounded group loss: reduction-based mitigation algorithms (Exponentiated Gradient and Grid Search)
